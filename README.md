I am a student from BUPT(Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications), team member of [Merak](https://we.buptmerak.cn/). I want to try something new and interesting projects.

My waifu is `skadi` from [Arknights](https://ak.hypergryph.com/)

I like sharing, feel free to talk to me anytime, any question or topic. And to argue with any point you disagree. 

I like ACGN and FPS/TPS games.
